# 1] Flappy Bird
-----
I am assuming that most of you know what Flappy Bird is, but for those who don't here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQoJZuBwrkU&ab_channel=IGN) showing off the game.

For the prompt we want you to remake the game. You don't need a start menu and your gameover can just be closing the program. I ***strongly*** encourage you to use an already premade engine such as [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted), but if you want to show off a bit you can make your own engine. Sprites will be provide however do be afraid to use other sprites.
